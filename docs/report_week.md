# Weekly Diets Report Rules

Normal diet count is always computed as:

normal = max(0, residents − special)

Weekly totals sum all 7 days, including days without special diets.

Notes:
- Residents come from the effective per-day calculation in Weekview Service.
- Special counts are the sum of marked non-normal diets.
- Normal is derived and is never manually registered.
