# Kommun 1.1 — Live Acceptance & UX Race

## Status

TECHNICAL AUTOMATED GATE = GO

LIVE ACCEPTANCE GATE 01 — CUSTOMER + SITE = GO

LIVE PILOT ACCEPTANCE = PENDING

## Baseline

- branch: feat/planera-app-shell-2026-03-03
- HEAD: 04731895afc290b7df4e65bdc15146f2f2b69daa
- 2342 passed
- 15 skipped
- 0 failed
- 3 warnings

## Gate 01 — Clean Customer + Site Onboarding

Status: GO

Manually proven:

- new customer creation
- new site creation
- separate customer Admin login in Firefox
- correct tenant/site context
- clean customer without leaked demo data
- persistence across separate session

## Gate 02 — Departments + Needs

Status: IN PROGRESS

Reached:

- Admin → Avdelningar → Create Department → Department Edit

Department Edit is currently classified as a HIGH UX area and is paused for challenger work before final pilot acceptance.

Gate 02 is not GO yet.

## Section B — Data Truth Assertions

Record these locks:

- Published Builder menu = canonical menu truth
- Department menu choice = canonical choice truth
- Registered needs/current quantities = business truth
- Portal = input/experience layer
- Planera 2.0 = production engine
- Weekview = operational projection
- No manual sync between Portal and Kitchen
- No second production/menu/choice truth

## Section B2 — Product Direction Locks

### Department Edit information model

Current recommended conceptual grouping:

- AVDELNINGEN
  - name
  - residence/facility relationship
  - baseline resident count
  - internal Department.notes / Faktaruta
- BEHOV
  - registered production-relevant needs
  - primary requirement
  - additional deviations
  - quantities
- SERVERINGSANPASSNINGAR
  - serving add-ons / adaptations
- VECKOVARIATIONER
  - varying resident counts
  - other genuinely week/day-specific operational exceptions

Requirement-group is a backend/domain term only; normal Kommun admins should not need to learn that term in the final UI.

### Department Edit UX findings

- UX-13 HIGH: Department Edit lacks a clear mental model/hierarchy.
- UX-14 HIGH: Multiple independent save actions make save scope unclear.
- UX-15 HIGH: Specialkost and Registrerade behov overlap semantically in the UI even though they represent different domain concepts.
- UX-16 HIGH: Requirement-group terminology is too technical for normal Kommun admin.
- UX-17 MEDIUM/HIGH: Serveringstillägg is presented as a technical row editor instead of clear operational information.
- UX-18 MEDIUM: Department list provides weak operational differentiation/status.

### Menu choice direction

The menu-choice operational workflow should not primarily live inside Department Edit.

Preferred primary surface for Kommun 1.1:

- Admin → Menyval

MVP scope:

- choose/view a published week
- show all departments
- status per department: Klar, Delvis klar, Ej påbörjad
- simple filter/segmented control: Alla, Behöver åtgärd
- show the days where a real menu choice is required
- show the department's current choice
- allow admin to change a department's menu choice
- after save, return naturally to the overview

Deferred from Kommun 1.1:

- push/reminder sending
- choice analytics
- popularity statistics
- historical dashboards
- raw-material forecasts
- generic cross-vertical choice analytics
- new statistics engine

### Admin override technical gate

Product intent:

- An admin/kitchen change is authoritative.
- If Admin changes a department choice, the effective production choice must follow the admin decision.

Current implementation note:

- Portal and Admin currently write into the same canonical department_menu_choices truth.
- The current implementation does not yet preserve three separate persisted concepts for original Portal choice, Admin override, and effective choice.

This is an open technical gate and must be revisited before implementing Admin → Menyval at full scope.

## Section C — UI/UX Race

For every major screen capture record:

- route/screen
- screenshot/reference
- task user is trying to complete
- friction
- severity: BLOCKER / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
- recommended action
- accepted/fixed/deferred

Initial screens to inspect:

1. Customer creation / onboarding
2. Site/kitchen setup
3. Departments list
4. Department create
5. Department detail
6. Department edit

Known concern:

Department edit is known to be visually and interaction-wise messy and requires serious UX review.

Then:

7. Needs / requirement-group administration
8. Builder import
9. Builder unresolved flow
10. Dish editor
11. Component editor
12. Publish flow
13. Kitchen Weekview
14. Planera entry/day overview
15. Planera review
16. Produktionsunderlag
17. Department Portal Home
18. Department Portal Week
19. Reports

Accepted product privacy distinction:

- Department-facing structured fact area stays visible to unit_portal.
- Department.notes / internal Faktaruta is private and must never render to unit_portal.

The privacy defect on the old compatibility Portal week surfaces was closed in commit 04731895afc290b7df4e65bdc15146f2f2b69daa.

UX principle:

Do not redesign everything blindly. First walk the real task, then screenshot, then identify friction, then challenge or redesign only where justified.

Tablet/iPad-first remains a core acceptance lens.

## Section D — Release Blockers

Only BLOCKER and HIGH issues can stop pilot unless the project lead decides otherwise.

| ID | Area | Finding | Severity | Owner | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Section E — Release Exit Criteria

Kommun 1.1 may become final PILOT READY only when:

- clean-customer chain passes
- lunch/kvällsmat/dessert Planera requirement is verified or an explicit product decision is made
- Portal and Kitchen show the same canonical publication and choices
- tenant and department scoping is proven
- no blocker-level UX failure remains
- accepted UX fixes are regression-tested
- final automated suite is green after any product changes
- pilot candidate HEAD is frozen/tagged

Current release sequence:

1. Gate 02 — Departments + needs
2. Department Edit UX challenger
3. Admin menu-choice technical semantics gate
4. Thin Admin → Menyval overview if implementation remains small
5. Continue clean-customer live E2E: published menu, Portal choices, Kitchen propagation, Planera, Produktionsunderlag, completion, Reports, persistence/relogin
6. UX race fixes
7. Final regression
8. Freeze/tag Kommun 1.1
9. Offshore 1.0

## Notes

This document is the working ledger for the live acceptance phase and the UX race.

The live acceptance status above reflects the manually proven customer/site onboarding gate and the currently paused Department Edit / department needs work.
