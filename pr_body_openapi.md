Add reference to `notes/openapi-validate.md` with CI command breakdown.

Clarification:
- No functional changes yet — waiting for next CI error list on PR #34.
- Marking as draft to stage the fix and enable CI visibility.

Plan:
- After the 0.3.0 blockers (#35–#38) merge and CI reruns on PR #34, I will commit the minimal schema fixes here so `openapi-spec-validator`, Spectral lint, and tests pass.
