# Changelog

## [0.3.0] - 2025-09-30 (Auth Hardening & Security)
### Security / Auth
- JWT auth (access ~10m, refresh ~14d) with refresh rotation & replay protection via stored `refresh_token_jti`.
- New endpoints: `/auth/login`, `/auth/refresh`, `/auth/logout`, `/auth/me`.
- RBAC enforcement: user (own tasks), admin (tenant-wide), superuser (cross-tenant & feature flag targeting) with task ownership checks.
- In-memory rate limiting buckets: `tasks_mutations`, `feature_flags_admin` + forced test hooks (`X-Force-Rate-Limit*`).
- Standardized 401 / 403 / 429 OpenAPI reusable responses; added BearerAuth security scheme & security arrays on protected paths.
- Centralized task status transition audit logging (`core.audit`).
- Security headers: CSP, HSTS (non-debug/non-test), X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy.

### Domain & Spec
- Task creation 201 + Location header.
- Task.status column + migration (backfill from legacy done) and expanded enum (todo|doing|blocked|done|cancelled).
- OpenAPI examples for create/update/invalid status; 429 responses on rate-limited endpoints.

### Developer Experience
- README Auth Quickstart (login, refresh rotation, RBAC, rate limits, CSP note).
- Added dedicated auth / RBAC / rate limit test suite.
- Audit helper for consistent transitions logging.

### Notes / Future
- CSP still allows `'unsafe-inline'` temporarily (UI refactor planned to remove).
- Rate limiter currently in-memory; plan Redis backend for multi-process scaling.

## Earlier (Scaffold Phase & 0.2.x)
- Initial schema + Alembic baseline.
- Unified error model and OpenAPI error components.
- Feature flags with tenant overrides + admin endpoints.
- Notes & Tasks basic CRUD + inline UI.
- UI enhancements: status pill, spinner styling, toast dedupe.
- CI publishes `openapi.json` artifact & summary.

## [0.3.1] - 2025-10-01 (Typing Wave 2 & Tooling Baseline)
### Internal / Code Quality
- Achieved mypy clean state (0 errors) across core runtime and active module services.
- Introduced TypedDict for JWT decode payload (`DecodedToken`) eliminating `Any` return.
- Refactored DB engine init to remove unreachable branches; clarified force re-init semantics.
- Normalized service return types (menu, diet, attendance, portion, turnus) with explicit annotations & assertions.
- Removed legacy `# type: ignore` comments where no longer needed; added minimal helper for dynamic `menu_service` attribute resolution.
- Refactored portion recommendation selection loops to reduce false positive unreachable warnings.

### Lint / Static Analysis
- Ruff baseline locked to `E,F,I` (errors, pyflakes, import sorting) – all passing.
- Planned next rule expansion: `B`, `UP`, `Q` (pending).
- Added Developer Tooling README section (usage of `ruff check` & staged mypy adoption strategy).

### Developer Notes
- Established v0.3.1 tag as stable starting point before broadening lint rule set.
- Next steps: expand Ruff rules, add badges, document example type error remediation, phase out ignore blocks in `mypy.ini`.

## [Unreleased]
### Internal / Code Quality
- Introduced first strict mypy pocket (`core.jwt_utils`, `core.rate_limit`, `core.audit`, `core.db`) with `strict = True` enforcement.
- Added PIE & SIM Ruff rule groups; resolved all simplification warnings in core.
- Added pre-commit hooks (Ruff lint+format, mypy, merge marker guard).
- README updated with strict pocket workflow and active modules list.
 - Added second strict mypy pocket: `core.portion_recommendation_service`, `core.menu_service`, `core.service_metrics_service` (TypedDict structures for menu week view & service metrics rows; refined recommendation output typing).
 - Added third strict mypy pocket: `core.auth`, `core.feature_flags`.
	 - JWT payloads now explicit `AccessTokenPayload` & `RefreshTokenPayload` TypedDicts with claim validation (issuer defaulting, temporal skew handling, strict `type` enum, `nbf` guard).
	 - Feature flags refactored to typed registry (`FlagDefinition`, `FlagState`, `FlagMode`) with idempotent `add()` supporting string shorthand; `has()` helper for app factory integration.
	 - Expanded unit tests: JWT edge cases (missing claim, unknown type, bad signature, expired, nbf future, skew boundary) & feature flag registry behaviors (idempotent add, unknown flag error, disable/enable cycle, sorted listing).
	 - Definition of Done checklist for typing/security PRs documented in README.
